## Image Metadata Generation Process

ForVoyez leverages the power of OpenAI's advanced language models to generate image metadata. The process involves the following steps:

1. The user sends an image file along with optional context and a custom JSON schema to the ForVoyez API.
2. The image is preprocessed and analyzed using computer vision techniques.
3. The extracted visual features are combined with the provided context and fed into OpenAI's language models.
4. The language models generate relevant and SEO-optimized alternative text, titles, and captions based on the image content and context.
5. The generated metadata is structured according to the provided JSON schema and returned to the user.

ForVoyez continuously improves its metadata generation capabilities by fine-tuning the language models on a diverse dataset of image-metadata pairs.

## API Usage Tracking

Users can monitor their API usage and quota limits directly through the ForVoyez web interface. The dashboard provides detailed statistics and charts showing the number of API calls made, credits consumed, and remaining quota for the current billing period.
