## Development

To set up the development environment for ForVoyez, follow these steps:

You can use the following Docker command to set up a PostgreSQL database for local development:
```bash
docker run --name forvoyez-postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=forvoyez -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=forvoyez -e POSTGRES_DB=forvoyez -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd forvoyez`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `bun install`

5. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file and fill in the required environment variables.
6. Run database migrations: `npm run prisma-migrate`
7. Generate Prisma client: `npm run prisma-generate`
8. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## Image Metadata Generation Process

ForVoyez leverages the power of OpenAI's advanced language models to generate image metadata. The process involves the following steps:

1. The user sends an image file along with optional context and a custom JSON schema to the ForVoyez API.
2. The image is preprocessed and analyzed using computer vision techniques.
3. The extracted visual features are combined with the provided context and fed into OpenAI's language models.
4. The language models generate relevant and SEO-optimized alternative text, titles, and captions based on the image content and context.
5. The generated metadata is structured according to the provided JSON schema and returned to the user.

ForVoyez continuously improves its metadata generation capabilities by fine-tuning the language models on a diverse dataset of image-metadata pairs.

## API Usage Tracking

Users can monitor their API usage and quota limits directly through the ForVoyez web interface. The dashboard provides detailed statistics and charts showing the number of API calls made, credits consumed, and remaining quota for the current billing period.
