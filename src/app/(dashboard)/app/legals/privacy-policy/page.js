					{`Like most website operators, ForVoyez collects
						non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
						and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
						language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
						visitor request. ForVoyez's purpose in collecting non-personally
						identifying information is to better understand how ForVoyez's
						visitors use its website. From time to time, ForVoyez may release
						non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
						publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.`}

					ForVoyez also collects potentially personally-identifying information

					Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
				</h2>
				<p className="mt-1 text-sm text-slate-600">
					{`Certain visitors to ForVoyez's websites choose to interact with
						ForVoyez in ways that require ForVoyez to gather
						personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information
						that ForVoyez gathers depend on the nature of the interaction. For
						example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at forvoyez.com to
						provide a name, phone number, and email address. Those who engage in
						transactions with ForVoyez – by purchasing access to the ForVoyez paid
						service, for example – are asked to provide additional information,
						including as necessary the personal and financial information required
						to process those transactions. In each case, ForVoyez collects such
						information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the
						purpose of the visitor's interaction with ForVoyez. ForVoyez does not
						disclose personally-identifying information other than as described
						below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying
						information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in
						certain website-related activities.`}

						necessary to protect the property or rights of ForVoyez, third
						parties, or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a
						ForVoyez website and have supplied your email address, ForVoyez may
						occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit
						your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with
						ForVoyez and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a
